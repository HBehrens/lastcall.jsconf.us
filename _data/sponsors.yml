    [ETA](http://www.emergingtechnologyadvisors.com/) started as a team of technologists helping companies to solve complex
    problems. Our love of all things technology didn't stop there — in our
    spare time, we were building robots, creating developer events
    ([JSConf](http://jsconf.us), [RobotsConf](http://robotsconf.com),
    [NodeBots](http://nodebots.io), etc.), and helping kids. At the same
    time, our clients started voicing concerns over the challenges of the
    fast-evolving, high-tech 21<sup>st</sup>-century work environment -
    and the need for a workforce that could keep pace. So the idea was
    born: emerging technology consulting with fascinating education,
    and help build or re-inspire the pipeline of talent that companies
    need, while giving individuals the drive and skills to succeed.
