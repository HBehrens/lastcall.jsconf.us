    <p><strong>Last Call?</strong></p>
    <p>Since JSConf US 2015, Laura Williams suffered from a very severe neurological issue that has left her on a long
      road of recovery. Due to this, JSConf US, at least as it has been organized thus far, will be on hold for the
      foreseeable future. That said, we had already reserved the Omni for a December event so it was decided to have one
      last call for JSConf US. One final time to remember all of the great times, all of the special moments, all of the
      family that has become JSConf.

  <p>Dear JS Community,</p>
  <p>I am <a href="http://voodootikigod.com">Chris Williams</a>, co-creator of JSConf, and I have some rather sad news
    to share with you. My co-creator for this event and more importantly my wife Laura Williams has suffered from a very
    severe neurological infection of which she is currently recovering through with no short term memory. I have to
    focus on caring for her and helping her and our family to recover through this very scary and very stressful time.
    Unfortunately, in 2014 we contracted our venue for 2 years not having a clue anything like this could ever happen.
    I had built JSConf US in a manner that it could help other conferences out of such a catastrophe, never thinking I
    would be the one to need it most, but alas here I am.
  </p>
    <p>
      I have already removed myself from any and all of my technical obligations and ownerships, tranferring them to
      individuals I trust and greatly appreciate. At this point, within the tech field, there are only two things
      directly connected to me, <a href="http://robotsconf.com">RobotsConf</a> and JSConf. I, and the amazing people
      who help me (Ken Henderson, Derek Lindahl, and Tara Lindahl among many others), cannot confidently pull off
      another RobotsConf this year with everything on my plate. I have made the decision to put on a final call event
      of JSConf US over December 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> and provide this community with one last gathering
      curated by me for the foreseeable future. This event will simultaneously be very much a JSConf US, while also
      having to shed many of the wonderful things that Laura brought to the event to make it special. This event will be
      smaller because it needs to be in order for me to accomplish it without letting the quality of life and care for
      my wife and family to suffer. It will not be able to provide for everyone's unique needs because for once, I have
      to first and foremost provide for my own unique needs. If that offends or upsets, I openly apologize, but I cannot provide
      anything more than that.
  </p>

  <p>I have given pretty much every bit of my energy, being, and ability to this community. I have
      nothing but love and respect for every single person in the JS community and if I could continue on I would.
      Unfortunately, it is not in the cards for that to happen, so this event will have to be my goodbye until things
      drastically change for the better.</p>

  <p>With many tears,</p>
  <p>Chris Williams</p>

      <h2 >What is this?</h2>
      <p>We have been doing {{site.shortname}} for 7 years with more than 10 events across the world and every single one has been better than the previous, it is something we take a great deal of pride in. We make events that aren't from the standard conference playbook, because we believe you deserve more than that. We have always retained some core concepts, the most fundamental of which is to always focus on the human social development aspect of the event. The second is to always indulge every attendee well beyond that which they have paid. The third is to always treat attendees, staff, sponsors, and speakers with the utmost of respect and appreciation. We have been a launching point for an incredible number of the most revolutionary products, services, and technologies on the web.</p>

      <p>The {{site.shortname}} team is constantly working to make the best technology event possible, which means not just creating events, but embracing a mission. Whether it is actively working to fix the diversity in computing issue, helping to feed the hungry, or trying to fix the rampant negativity in our community, we are deeply dedicated to making our (and your) world a better place. We want you to be part of it, we want you to be part of the {{site.shortname}} family and help us with our mission.</p>
