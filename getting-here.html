<h1>Getting to and from {{site.name}}</h1>
<p>The Omni Amelia Island Plantation Resort is on Amelia Island in northeast Florida, just across the St. Marys River from Georgia and adjacent to the historic city of Fernandina. The resort overlooks the azure blue waters of the Atlantic Ocean on the east and the Intracoastal Waterway on the west. Though private, secluded and protected by a gated entry, it is relatively easy to get to.</p>
<p>It is just a short 45 minute drive from downtown Jacksonville, and 29 miles from Jacksonville International Airport. </p>
