  <p>Dear JS Community,</p>
  <p>I am <a href="http://voodootikigod.com">Chris Williams</a>, co-creator of JSConf, and I have some rather sad news
    to share with you. My co-creator for this event and more importantly my wife Laura Williams has suffered from a very
    severe neurological infection of which she is currently recovering through with no short term memory. I have to
    focus on caring for her and helping her and our family to recover through this very scary and very stressful time.
    Unfortunately, in 2014 we contracted our venue for 2 years not having a clue anything like this could ever happen.
    I had built JSConf US in a manner that it could help other conferences out of such a catastrophe, never thinking I
    would be the one to need it most, but alas here I am.
  </p>
    <p>
      I have already removed myself from any and all of my technical obligations and ownerships, tranferring them to
      individuals I trust and greatly appreciate. At this point, within the tech field, there are only two things
      directly connected to me, <a href="http://robotsconf.com">RobotsConf</a> and JSConf. I, and the amazing people
      who help me (Ken Henderson, Derek Lindahl, and Tara Lindahl among many others), cannot confidently pull off
      another RobotsConf this year with everything on my plate. I have made the decision to put on a final call event
      of JSConf US over December 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> and provide this community with one last gathering
      curated by me for the foreseeable future. This event will simultaneously be very much a JSConf US, while also
      having to shed many of the wonderful things that Laura brought to the event to make it special. This event will be
      smaller because it needs to be in order for me to accomplish it without letting the quality of life and care for
      my wife and family to suffer. It will not be able to provide for everyone's unique needs because for once, I have
      to first and foremost provide for my own unique needs. If that offends or upsets, I openly apologize, but I cannot provide
      anything more than that.
  </p>

  <p>I have given this community pretty much every bit of my energy, being, and ability to this community. I have
      nothing but love and respect for every single person involved in web community and if I could continue on I would.
      Unfortunately it was not in the cards for that to happen, so this event will have to be my goodbye until things
      drastically change for the better.</p>

  <p>With many tears,</p>
  <p>Chris Williams</p>
