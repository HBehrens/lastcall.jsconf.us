  <!-- <h4>Facebook's Bike-as-an-Awesome</h4>
  <p class="hidden-xs">A fleet of bikes will be available allowing you to trek around the property on approximately seven miles of bicycle trails that will take you to some of Amelia Island Resort's points of interest such as Aury Island, Drummond Point Park and Walker's Landing. Resort trail maps and bikes will be available at Amelia's Wheels, just pick one up when you need/want one and return it once you are done!</p> -->

  <h3>Friday December 4th, 2015</h3>
  <!-- <h4>Cimpress Shuttles from Jacksonville International Airport to Amelia Island</h4>
  <p class="hidden-xs">Unless arriving by private jet or space craft, Amelia Island is quite remote and that is a very good thing for our purposes. Unfortunately it does make getting here a little complex, but to make it a little easier we will be providing shuttles from the airport on a schedule interval. Details for the shuttles and other modes of transportation to the venue are <a href="/getting-here.html">available here</a>.</p> -->

  <h4>Welcome Reception  6:00PM - 9:00PM</h4>
  <p class="hidden-xs"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/24453935@N00/8929311064"><img class='img-responsive hidden-xs hidden-xs' src="/img/banner/beach3.jpg" alt="Sand underneath your toes"/></a></p>
  <p class="hidden-xs">After a long day of travel, land at the beach for an evening welcome reception and social gathering. Meet old friends, make new friends, and enjoy the sand between your toes! We will have various things going on during this event including light appetizers and refreshments.</p>

  <!-- <h4>Respoke Karaoke Night at Falcon's Nest<br/> 9:00PM - 12:00AM</h4>
  <p class="hidden-xs">Come sing and dance your heart out at the local sports bar to some of the greatest 80s songs as sung by your peers (for better or worse). We have clearance from the Omni to have the time of our lives! *clap* *clap* Join us over at the Falcon's Nest just a 5 minute walk from the hotel.</p> -->



  <h3>Saturday December 5th, 2015</h3>
  <!-- <h4>Conde Nast's <a href="/sotrack.html">Significant Others Track</a> - 9:30AM - 5:00PM</h4>
  <p class="hidden-xs">If you are traveling with someone that is a ticketed JSConf attendee, we will once again be setting up our famous Significant Others track with non-JS activities! This track will require a registration fee this year with details to be announced later. Be sure to check <a href="/sotrack.html">the significant others track page</a> often for updates. It is always an incredible time and open to significant others of all ages.</p> -->



  <h4 id='conftracks'>Conference Tracks</h4>
  <div class='hidden-xs'>
  <h4>What is Track A</h4>
  <p class="hidden-xs">Traditionally a two track conference format, JSConf US provides a track of curated set of speakers as <a href="/call-for-speakers.html">outlined here</a> that have submitted the proposal and successfully made it through the selection process. </p>

  <h4>What is Track B</h4>
  <p>The alternative track for JSConf US is driven by people like you! We have a very unique format for our second track in that we let anyone register to speak in a first-come, first-speaking format. These talks are generally from the full range of node.js development and are some of the most exciting talks at JSConf. Registration opens about one month before the event.</p>
